# Spring Boot Database Learning Project

This is a **learning project** where I explore setting up a Spring Boot backend and integrating it with databases.

### ðŸ›  What this project covers:
- Setting up a basic **Spring Boot** application
- Working with **PostgreSQL** and **H2** (in-memory) databases
- Creating **DAO (Data Access Object)** layers
- Writing simple SQL schemas and interacting with data
- Practicing **dependency injection** and Spring configuration

### ðŸš€ Purpose
The goal of this project is to build hands-on experience with:
- Backend development using Java + Spring Boot
- Connecting to and managing relational databases
- Understanding how to configure, query, and test database layers in a Spring app

This project is **not production-ready** â€” itâ€™s purely for learning, experimentation, and skill-building.

### ðŸ“¦ Technologies used
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- PostgreSQL
- H2 Database (for testing)
- Maven
